# pokemon

Based off a previous [Rust package](https://github.com/emzinnia/pokemon) I wrote, which itself is based off an [npm package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pokemon) by Sindre Sorhous. 

[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/pokemon)](https://hex.pm/packages/pokemon)
[![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-ffaff3)](https://hexdocs.pm/pokemon/)

```sh
gleam add pokemon@1
```
```gleam
import pokemon

pub fn main() -> Nil {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/pokemon>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
